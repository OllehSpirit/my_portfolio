      <p>A Bit About Me</p>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m <span style="color: var(--mainColor);font-weight: 600;">Anas Attoum</span> <br />
        A Front-End Web Developer
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always been amazed at how web sites interface are made, That is what got me into learning Front-End
        development so i started working on web design using Figma after that I focused on mastering ReactJS to convert
        designs to reality, so it would become an actual interactive web pages.
        <!-- , finally i wanted to be able to build a integrated site by learning a Back-End development framework which was
        Django and that was my journey into
        becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer. -->

        As an IT-Engineer i believe that leaning AI and machine learning will open doors to make our websites more
        dynamic and interactive.
      </p>
      <p class="endIntro">So, Let’s Work Together</p>
